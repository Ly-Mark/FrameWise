Working as a laboratory technician,
the most exciting part of my job was improving
and tinkering with different ways to present results that were clear and made sense.
That sparked an interest in finding a career where I could do that all day,
leading to my path of becoming a data scientist.

> I am a passionate data scientist with statistics, programming, data analysis, and data visualization expertise.

After graduating from the University of Calgary with a Master's in Data Science and Analytics,
specializing in biostatistics and health data,
I worked as a data scientist at the same university in the Center of Health Informatics (CHI),
where I worked closely with Dr. Na Li.

Nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

Informal learning is less structured than "nonformal" one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, play, exploring, etc.

The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.
